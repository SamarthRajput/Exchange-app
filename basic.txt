An Exchange is the real thing that lets you swap assets good example is
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NSE (national stock Exchange), BSE (Bombay stock Exchange)
Robinhood, zerodha, groww these are brokers, these are build on top of NSE or BSE 
We are building an Exchange


The current price is the price at which the last trade is happened.
Time series data, a data of price over time on this Exchange, finally plotted on the graph
The graph we are seeing is a commonly used library called trading view, which most of the exchanges, price trackers use 
The orderbook is the list of people that are currently willing to buy or sell this asset, the orderbook is whats make trading possible 
if you are making an exchange the first thing you have to do is to build all the UI the frontend and backend, the second big thing you have to do is get market makers on board

Orderbook is the central book where 2 types of order are present the seller and the buyer
the broker sitting in the middle and maintaining these orders, whenever 2 parties come, where a deal can happen it takes that off the order book lets them the deal is done and swaps the assets
The bottom orders with green in the order book are known as bids people willing to buy the stock, the above orders with red in the order book are known as asks
The thing below is, in the orderbook is I am willing to buy for this much
The thing above is, in the orderbook is I am willing to sell for this much 

you have to talk to a bunch of market makers and tell them we are building an exchange pls come and provide liquidity, pls come put some orders on both the sides (I am willing to buy on x, I am willing to sell on y )

A limit order states that I want to buy TATA stocks 1 quantity but at Rs 200/stock, you strictly put up a limit, ki I will not give a penny above rs 200, if you can fill this order great
If you can't fill up this order put this on the order book, all these order we can see on the orderbook are limit orders can be placed by retail as well 
The orderbook keeps on changing very quickly based on the algorithm the market makers run 

Usually when you trade there is a currency on one side for ex USDC is a currency, INR is a currency and an asset on the another side ETH (ethereum) is an asset, TATA is an asset 
whenever you trade ETH-BTC (eth for btc), if you ever say ki I want to sell one ethereum give me bitcoin in return, usually there are 2 markets that you are trading on in a single swap 
You are first selling your ethereum for USDC, then you are using you USDC to buy bitcoin, you use combination of 2 markets here

Base asset -> The asset that is being traded(TATA)
Quote asset -> The asset that is being traded with. 
People usually prefer more liquid exchanges, the more liquid your exchanges the better exchanges, the more traders will be there, more people want to trade there
more liquidity means better prices, the price you get is much better on a liquid exchange 
Market markers that keep the orderbook liquid 

The api/v1/order/quote endpoint of the backend is really an important endpoint especially for retail users 

All orders are limit orders -> Every time you place an order, you should give it some price expectations, even if you are placing a market order, The exchange automatically adds the constraints and creates a limit order 
you might want to create a market order, but the exchange will make sure it gets whats called a quote,
It gets ki yaar if a person is coming and about to spend 8cr for a house the quote will be 3.334cr 


We will try to hit the backend, assume the backend of the exchange exists, we will hit the websocket server of an existing exchange and make our frontend dynamic 
We are proxing a lot of requests from our server to the exchange, so the exchange might rate limit our proxy server, might not as well 
We are proxing these requests through our own server because of some cors issues, if you directly try to hit the exchange api from the browser, the browser will give you some cors issues 
which is why we are proxing the server apis 

we will create our own proxy server and deploy it on aws ourselfves. 

The api/v1/depth?symbol=${market} -> this returns data of the shape, ki the asks are an array of tuples, tuple is an array with 2 values 
The first value of which has 2 values, the 2nd value of which has 2 values so on and so forth 

The person who is willing to buy is at max giving 133.44 and the person who is willing to sell is selling at max 133.45, then how is the price is 133.47 ?
On the particular exchange, 133.47 is the price on which the last trade happened and the market moved after it, just because the current bid is 133.44 and curr ask is 133.45 doesnot means 
ki the price can be 133.47, the price can still be 133.47 because the last trade when it happened the orderbook might be different

The backend returns you 100 bids and 100 asks, we have to return the best 15 asks and 15 bids to the frontend
